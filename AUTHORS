C-BGP is written and maintained by Bruno Quoitin
(bruno.quoitin@uclouvain.be) within the Computer Science and
Engineering Department at the Universite Catholique de Louvain (UCL),
in Belgium.

Contributors:

* Bruno Quoitin (UCL, Belgium)
    is the main author.

* Virginie Van den Schrieke (UCL, Belgium)
    is currently implementing a model of HLP in C-BGP.

* Sebastien Tandel (former UCL member)
    wrote the initial Python module that interfaces with C-BGP and
    contributed to the integration within the TOTEM toolbox (loading
    XML topologies). He also improved the BGP filters by adding
    route-maps and regular expressions on AS-Paths. He worked on
    building a C-BGP model of a large transit network (more). In
    addition, he is investigating forwarding deflection that may occur
    due to route-reflection.

* Stefano Iasi (Politecnico di Torino, Italy)
    worked on an OSPF model for C-BGP that supports multiple areas and
    Equal-Cost Multiple Paths (ECMP). He also investigated the
    forwarding deflection that may occur in OSPF networks.

* Cedric de Launois (former UCL member)
    helped writing the initial autoconf/automake scripts.
