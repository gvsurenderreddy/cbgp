How to generate and install documentation
=========================================

Overview
--------
C-BGP documentation is maintained in XML files. Each C-BGP command is
associated with 2 different XML files.

  1). The first file is named LINKS_<cmd>.xml where <cmd> is the name
  of the command. This file contains links to other nodes
  (sub/parent/previous/next commands). This file is generated
  automatically.

  2). The second file is named <cmd>.xml where <cmd> is the name of
  the command. This file contains the actual documentation. The first
  version of this file is generated automatically. It is then manually
  edited so as to contain the command and parameters description.


Maintaining documentation
-------------------------
The documentation should be maintained when the behavior of an
existing command is changed, when new commands are added or when
commands are removed (deprecated).

To check if the current documentation structure is in-line with the
supported C-BGP commands, simply run the cbgp2doc.pl script as
follows. Assuming you are currently in the documentation folder, run

	../src/cbgp -e "show commands" | perl cbgp2doc.pl --check

The invocation of C-BGP with the -e <cmd> option runs a single
command. The purpose of the "show commands" command is to list all
C-BGP commands along with their arguments and options. An example
output is as follows:

       bgp
         add
	   router <as-num> <addr>
	 assert
           peerings-ok
           reachability-ok
         clear-adj-rib
         clear-rib
         domain <as-number>
           full-mesh
           record-route [--deflection] <address|prefix>
       (...)

Each line corresponds to a single command. When a command (e.g. "bgp") has child
commands (e.g. "add"), the child commands are listed below the parent
command and the line is indented by 2 spaces. This allows for discovering
the hierarchy of commands. If a command requires arguments and/or
accepts options, these arguments and options are printed on the same
line, just after the name of the command. Mandatory arguments are
enclosed with < > while optional arguments are enclosed with [ ].


Subdirectory structure
----------------------
The documentation directories are organized as follows

  doc/
    xml/
      index.xml           -> source index (generated)
      toc.xml             -> source table of content (generated)
      nodes/              -> source XML documentation files (edited)
        LINKS_<cmd>.xml
        <cmd>.xml
      xsl/                -> XSL transformation scripts
    html/                 -> generated HTML files
    tex/                  -> generated LaTeX files + PDF documentation
    txt/                  -> generated TXT files


Generating documentation
------------------------
To generate initial documentation, from the 'doc' directory use
cbgp2doc.pl as follows

   ../src/cbgp -e "show commands" | perl cbgp2doc.pl

This will generate files into the 'xml' and 'xml/nodes'
directories. The index.xml and toc.xml files are generated in 'xml'
while all LINKS_<cmd>.xml and <cmd>.xml files are generated in
'xml/nodes'. If a <cmd>.xml file already exists, it will not be
overwritten.

Then, from the 'doc/xml' directory, generate the output files in HTML,
text and LaTeX, using the provided Makefile as follows

    make

Alternatively, you can generate the output separately for the various
formats, using

    make html     -> produces the HTML output
    make tex      -> produces the LaTeX output
    make txt      -> produces the text output, for use within c-bgp


Install documentation on SF server
----------------------------------
The documentation must be installed on 'web.sourceforge.net' for
ptoject 'c-bgp', under directory 'htdocs'.
