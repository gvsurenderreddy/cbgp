      optionnaly check for path deflection

     [[1m---delay [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optionnaly report the path's delay

     [[1m---ecmp [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optionally discover ECMP paths

     [[1m---load= [4m[22mvalue[24m]

     [[1m---tunnel [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optionally discover the path within tunnels

     [[1m---weight [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optionally report the path's IGP weight

     <[4maddress|prefix[24m> destination address or prefix

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command records the addresses of the nodes that packet sent from the
     source [4maddress[24m traverse to reach the [4mdestination[24m address. The [4mdestination[0m
     may be an IP address or an IP prefix. In the case of an IP address, the
     trace stops only when a node with the specified address is reached. In
     the case of an IP prefix, the trace stops as soon as a node with an IP
     address that matches the specified prefix is reached.

     Output format:


     <source> <destination> <result> <num-hops> <list of hops> [options]



     The value of [4mresult[24m is one of


           [4mSUCCESS[24m The destination was reachable. In this case, the list of
           hops is the list of the IP adresses of the traversed nodes.

           [4mUNREACH[24m The destination was not reachable. In this case, the list
           of hops is the list of IP addresses of the nodes traversed until no
           route was available.

           [4mTOO_LONG[24m The path towards the destination was too long (i.e. longer
           than 30 hops). This is often the symptom of a routing loop.

           [4mDOWN[24m there was a route to reach the destination, but a link down
           was found on the way. This indicates a misconfiguration or routing
           error. This can however occur in transient states, after a link has
           been brought down and the routing has not reconverged. The last
           node in the list of hops indicates the node adjacent to the failing
           link.

           [4mLOOP[24m If the option [4m--check-loop[24m has been specified and a forwarding
           loop is found, then this status is reported.

           [4mTUNNEL_UNREACH[24m The path went through a tunnel but the tunnel end-
           point does not support the IP-in-IP protocol. Consider using the
           [1mnet node ipip-enable [22m. The last node in the list of hops is the
           address of the faulty node.

           [4mTUNNEL_BROKEN[24m The path went through a tunnel but at a point the
           tunnel end-point was not reachable. The last node in the list of
           hops is the address of the faulty node.


     Example:


     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.1 record-route 1.0.0.2
     1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2 SUCCESS 3       1.0.0.1 1.0.0.3 1.0.0.2
     cbgp>



     Here is another example that traces all the equal-cost paths (ECMP)
     between two nodes:

     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.0 record-route --ecmp 1.0.0.4
     1.0.0.0 1.0.0.4 SUCCESS 4       1.0.0.0 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.3 1.0.0.4
     1.0.0.0 1.0.0.4 SUCCESS 4       1.0.0.0 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.3 1.0.0.4
     cbgp>

     reachability of nodes.

[1mBUGS[0m
     IMPORTANT NOTE: due to changes in the network topology data structure and
     in the way tunnels are handled, the tunnel tracing feature is currently
     broken. Tracing route through tunnels is therefore temporarily disabled.
