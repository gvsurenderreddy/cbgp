     <[4min|out[24m> filter direction

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command can be used to associate an input or an output filter to a
     BGP session with a peer. The direction of the filter is specified using
     the argument [1min|out [22m. If the argument is "in", the filter is an input
     filter, i.e. it will be applied on routes received from the peer. If the
     argument is "out", the filter is an output filter, i.e. it will be
     applied on routes sent to the peer.

     A filter is composed of a sequence of rules. You can add rules to an
     existing filter using command [1madd-rule [22m.

     Here is an example script that defines an output filter for routes sent
     by router 1.0.0.1 to its peer 1.0.0.2. The filter is composed of two
     rules. The first rule rejects (denies) all routes that have community 1.
     The second rule accepts all remaining routes.

     bgp router 1.0.0.1 peer 1.0.0.2
       filter out
         add-rule
           match "community is 1"
           action "deny"
           exit
         add-rule
           match "any"
           action "accept"
           exit
