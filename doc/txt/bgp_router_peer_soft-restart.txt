[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command activates "soft-restart" on a virtual peer. Soft-restart
     allows virtual peers to keep their routes when their session is teared
     down.

     Since the routes available to virtual peers are learned through the [1mbgp[0m
     [1mrouter peer recv [22mcommand, they are lost when the session with the virtual
     peer is teared down. With the soft-restart option, the Adj-RIB-in corre-
     sponding to the virtual peer is not cleared when the session is teared
     down. These routes are therefore still available upon session restart.
