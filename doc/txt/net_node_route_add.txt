     [1mnet node route add [22m-- add a static route to a node

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1madd [22m[[1m---gw=[22m] [[1m---oif=[22m] <[4mprefix[24m> <[4mweight[24m>

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     [[1m---gw= [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optional gateway address

     [[1m---oif= [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optional outgoing interface

     <[4mprefix[24m> destination prefix

     <[4mweight[24m> weight associated with the route

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command adds a static route towards a specific [4mprefix[24m to a node. The
     route can take different forms.


           [4m--oif[0m

           if [4m--oif[24m is specified, then the route will send messages towards
           the [4mprefix[24m through the specified outgoing interface.

           [4m--gw[0m

           if [4m--gw[24m is specified, then the route will send messages towards the
           [4mprefix[24m through the specified gateway. A second lookup is performed
           to find the outgoing interface for that gateway.

           [4m--oif[24m and [4m--gw[0m

           if both [4m--oif[24m and [4m--gw[24m are specified, then the route will send mes-
           sages towards the [4mprefix[24m through the specified gateway. The gateway
           is reached through the specified outgoing interface.


     The following example illustrates how to configure static routes in a
     simple topology composed of 3 nodes, one point-to-point link and a link
     through a subnet:

     net add node 1.0.0.1
     net add node 1.0.0.2
     net add node 1.0.0.3
     net add subnet 192.168.0.0/24 transit
     net add link 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2
     net add link 1.0.0.2 192.168.0.1/24
     net add link 1.0.0.3 192.168.0.2/24

     net node 1.0.0.1 route add --oif=1.0.0.2 1.0.0.2/32 1
     net node 1.0.0.1 route add --oif=1.0.0.2 1.0.0.3/32 1

     net node 1.0.0.2 route add --oif=1.0.0.1 1.0.0.1/32 1
     net node 1.0.0.2 route add --oif=192.168.0.1 192.168.0.0/24 1
     net node 1.0.0.2 route add --gw=192.168.0.2 1.0.0.3/32 1

     net node 1.0.0.3 route add --oif=192.168.0.2 192.168.0.0/24 1
     net node 1.0.0.3 route add --gw=192.168.0.1 1.0.0.1/32 1
     net node 1.0.0.3 route add --gw=192.168.0.1 1.0.0.2/32 1



[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     To remove a static route, use command [1mnet node X route del [22m.

     To show existing routes, use command [1mnet node X show rt [22m.


     Another mean to obtain routing information is to rely on routing proto-
     cols.  [4mC-BGP[24m contains two routing protocol models: an intradomain routing
     protocol (IGP) and an interdomain routing protocol (BGP). See command [1mnet[0m
     [1mdomain compute [22mto learn more about the IGP model configuration. See com-
     mand [1mbgp add router [22mto learn more about the BGP model.
