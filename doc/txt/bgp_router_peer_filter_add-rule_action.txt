     The action expression argument must be quoted (except for "accept" and
     "deny" which are single words).

     The following example defines a filter rule that prepends twice the AS-
     path of routes with community 1 or community 2:

     add-rule
       match "community is 1 | community is 2"
       action "as-path prepend 2"
