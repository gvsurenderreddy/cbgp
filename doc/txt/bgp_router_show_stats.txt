[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command shows various statistics about a router. The currently
     available statistics are: the number of peers, the number of locally
     originated networks, the number of best routes, the number of times each
     rule of the decision process was used and the number of prefixes learned
     by each peer. This command is mainly used for debugging purposes. Its
     output format might change without notice.

     Here is an example output:

     cbgp> bgp router 1.0.0.2 show stats
     num-peers: 2
     num-networks: 1
     num-best: 3
     rule-stats: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
