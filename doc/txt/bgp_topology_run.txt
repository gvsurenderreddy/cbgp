     [1mrun[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command establishes the BGP sessions between all the routers loaded
     by commands [1mbgp topology load [22mand [1mbgp topology install [22m. This is equiva-
     lent to calling command [1mbgp router X peer up [22mon every session.

     Note that this command will set the sessions administratively up. BGP
     messages need to be exchanged to complete the sessions establishments.
     These messages will be put into the simulator's queue. You will need to
     issue a [1msim run [22mto process them.
