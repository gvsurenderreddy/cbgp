[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command is used to load into one BGP router a dump of a [4mRouting[0m
     [4mInformation[24m [4mBase[24m (RIB) captured on a real router. The RIB dump must be
     provided in ASCII MRT format.

     Note: [4mC-BGP[24m performs some consistency checks on the routes that are
     loaded. First, the IP address and the AS number of the peer router speci-
     fied in the MRT route records must correspond to the given router. Sec-
     ond, the IP address of the BGP next-hop must correspond to an existing
     peer of the router. This constraint might be too strong and might be
     relaxed in the future.
