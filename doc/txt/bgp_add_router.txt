     This command adds BGP support into the node identified by [4maddress[24m . The
     node thus becomes a BGP router. The command also configures this router
     as a member of the domain identified by [4mas-num[24m .


     Example:


     # Add a new node to the topology
     net add node 0.1.0.0

     # Enable BGP support on this node and
     # place this new router in AS1
     bgp add router 1 0.1.0.0
