[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command shows the routes installed into the Loc-RIB of one router.
     The command takes one parameter to filter the output. The filter can be
     an IP address, an IP prefix or a wildcard (*). If the filter parameter is
     an IP address, the result will contain the routes that match the address
     (best-match). If the filter is an IP prefix, the result will only contain
     the routes towards the specified prefic (exact-match). Finally, if a
     wildcard is given, all the routes will be dumped.

     The output format depends on the current mode, specified with the [1mbgp[0m
     [1moptions show-mode [22m. We show only examples in the CISCO-like output for-
     mat.


     CISCO-like output format:


     <flags> <prefix> <peer> <pref> <metric> <AS-Path> <origin>

     where the [4mflags[24m field can contain the following items:

           [1mFlags    Description[0m
           [1m*        [22mthe route's next-hop is reachable.
           [1m>        [22mthe route is a best route (installed in the Loc-RIB).
           [1mi        [22mthe route is local (installed with theSy bgp router add
                                   network command).
     Moreover, the [4morigin[24m field tells how the origin router learned the net-
     work prefix and it can take one of the following values:

           [1mOrigin    Description[0m
           [1mi         [22mthe route was learned through anSy bgp router add network
                                    statement.
           [1me         [22mthe route was learned from an EGP protocol.
           ?         the route was learned through redistribution from another
                                    protocol.


     Note: since the only way to learn a BGP route in [4mC-BGP[24m is currently
     through the [1mbgp router add network [22mstatement, the [4morigin[24m field will
     always be [1mi [22m.


     Example:


     cbgp> bgp router 0.0.0.1 show rib *
     i> 0.0.0.1/32   0.0.0.1 0       0       null    i
     *> 0.1.0.1/32   0.2.0.2 0       0       2 1     i
     *> 0.2.0.1/32   0.2.0.2 0       0       2       i
     *> 0.2.0.2/32   0.2.0.2 0       0       2       i
