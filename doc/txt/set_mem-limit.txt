     <[4mvalue[24m> new memory limit (in bytes)

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command changes the memory limit of [4mC-BGP[24m to a maximum of [4mvalue[0m
     bytes, using the [1msetrlimit [22msystem call. Normally, there is no per-process
     memory limitation enforced by the operating system. The memory allocation
     will fail when there is no more physical memory and no more virtual mem-
     ory available. However, in certain situations, reaching both the physical
     and virtual memory limits may pose problems. Especially on some systems
     (on Linux for instance) where the scheduler may kill the first applica-
     tion that requests memory above the reached limits. Important applica-
     tions may be killed even if the user who runs the simulator has no admin-
     istrative privilege. We experienced such situation, so use this option
     with large simulations!!!
