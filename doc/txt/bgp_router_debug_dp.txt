     <[4mprefix[24m> destination prefix to examine

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command allows to examine the decision process steps in one router
     for a specifix prefix. The command takes a single argument, the destina-
     tion prefix. The command shows the current best route. Then it lists the
     feasible routes available towards the specified destination. Finally, it
     shows each rule of the decision process and which routes remain after it.

     Here is an example of the output generated by this command. Four routes
     are available. All the routes have the same LOCAL-PREF, the same AS-PATH
     length, the same ORIGIN and the same MED value. All the routes are
     learned by 198.32.12.9 through iBGP. The tie-break occurs with the rule
     based on the IGP cost to the next-hop. After this rule, only one route
     remains and the decision process stops.
