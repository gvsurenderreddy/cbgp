[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mlinks[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command shows information on all the links of one node.

     Output format:


     <prefix> <delay> <metric> <state> <type> [<IGP option>]

     where the [4mstate[24m field can be either [1mUP [22mor [1mDOWN [22m. The [4mtype[24m field takes one
     of the following values:

           [1mValue    Description[0m
           [1mDIRECT   [22mThe link is a direct link towards the destination, i.e.
                                   the destination is adjacent to this node
           [1mTUNNEL   [22mThe link is a tunnel to the destination, i.e. messages
                                   that traverse this link will be
                                   encapsulated, then routed towards the
                                   tunnel end-point and hopefully decapsulated
                                   there.
     Finally, the [4mIGP[24m [4moption[24m field, if present, can contain the [1mIGP_ADV [22mflag
     which means that this link is taken into account by the IGP model for
     computing shortest-path routes (see [1mnet domain compute [22m).

     Example:


     cbgp> net node 0.0.0.1 show links
     0.2.0.1/32      444     444     UP      DIRECT  IGP_ADV
     0.2.0.2/32      370     370     UP      DIRECT  IGP_ADV



     Example (more recent output):


     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.3 show links
     ROUTER  1.0.0.1 10      5       UP      adv:yes
     ROUTER  1.0.0.2 10      4       UP      adv:yes
