[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Create a new IGP domain identified by [4mid[24m . An IGP domain is used to group
     nodes that participate in an IGP protocol (for example IS-IS or OSPF). In
     C-BGP, the IGP protocol model is static, meaning that the IGP routes com-
     putation is done in a centralized way and without exchanging messages.

     C-BGP was designed to support multiple IGP domain types. There is cur-
     rently a single domain [4mtype[24m supported: [1migp [22m. This domain type computes
     shortest-path trees between all its members according to the IGP weights
     assigned to the links.

     Use the  command to assign a node to an IGP domain. Use the  command to
     assign an IGP weight to an existing link.
