     [[1m---exact-match [4m[22mvalue[24m]

      optional output file

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command performs a [1mrecord-route [22mfor each router in the topology.

     The output can optionally be redirected to an output file using the
     [4m--output[24m option.

     Output format:


     <src-as-num> <prefix> <as-path>



     Example: For instance, here is the result of the EBGP_2_ROUTERS example.
     The path from AS1 is "1" because it has advertised the prefix 0.1/16. The
     path from AS2 is "2 1" because it has received a BGP message with the
     prefix 0.1/16 from AS1.


     1 0.1.0.0/16 1
     2 0.1.0.0/16 2 1
