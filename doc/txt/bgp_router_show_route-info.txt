[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command can be used to obtain details about the outcome of the deci-
     sion process for a single destination or for all destinations. The desti-
     nation can be specified as a prefix to perform an exact-match search in
     the router RIB, as an address to perform a best-match search or with a
     wildcard (*) if all destinations are requested.

     Here is an example output for this command. A wildcard has been used to
     request information about all known destinations. There are only 3 routes
     in the example. For each destination prefix, the decision process rule
     which made the final tie-break is displayed. The number of routes avail-
     able for this prefix is also shown. In the example, the router knows a
     single route for the 2nd and 3rd prefixes. For this reason, no decision
     process rule is shown, but the message "Single choice" is displayed
     instead.
