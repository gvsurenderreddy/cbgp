     [1mbgp router peer down [22m-- tear down a BGP session

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mdown[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command stops one BGP session. If the session was in ESTABLISHED
     state, a CLOSE BGP message is sent to the corresponding neighbor. The
     session is then set in the IDLE state.

     Note that if BGP messages need to be exchanged, they will be put into the
     simulator's queue. You will need to issue a [1msim run [22mto process them.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     To establish a session, use command [1mbgp router X peer up [22m.
