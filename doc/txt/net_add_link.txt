[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command adds a new link between two existing nodes whose identifiers
     are [4maddr-src[24m and [4maddr-dst[24m in the topology. The new link is bidirectional.

     Link bandwidth and delay can be specified optionally using the following
     options [4m--bw=[24m and [4m--delay=[24m .

     The option [4m--depth[24m specifies the number of different IGP weights that can
     be defined for this link. The default (without the option) is to support
     a single IGP weight. IGP weights are used to compute shortest-path
     routes. See commands [1mnet add domain [22mand [1mnet domain compute [22mfor more
     details.

     The following example shows how to add link between 2 nodes to create a
     simple topology:

     net add node 1.0.0.1
     net add node 1.0.0.2
     net add link 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2

     With the above example, nodes 1.0.0.1 and 1.0.0.2 will both have 2 inter-
     faces: one loopback interface and one rtr interface which correspond to
     the loopback of the linked node. This can be verified using command [1mnet[0m
     [1mnode X show ifaces [22mas show in the following example:

     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.1 show ifaces
     lo      1.0.0.1/32
     rtr     1.0.0.2/32



     This command can also be used to add a link between a node and a "subnet"
     (model of a LAN). To do this, the second node address ( [4maddr-dst[24m ) has a
     different meaning. It is the identifier of the target subnet combined
     with the address of the node's future interface on this subnet. This is
     specified in a prefix form. The address part is the interface address.
     The masked address and prefix length is the subnet identifier.

     The following example show how to add a link between 2 nodes and a sub-
     net. Nodes 1.0.0.1 and 1.0.0.2 will get new interfaces numbered
     192.168.0.5 and 192.168.0.7 respectively.

     net add node 1.0.0.1
     net add node 1.0.0.2
     net add subnet 192.168.0.0/16
     net add link 1.0.0.1 192.168.0.5/16
     net add link 1.0.0.2 192.168.0.7/16

     In this case, nodes will also have 2 interfaces: one loopback interface
     and one ptmp interface:

     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.1 show ifaces
     lo      1.0.0.1/32
     ptmp    192.168.0.5/16



[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     To create a subnet, use command [1mnet add subnet [22m.

     To add more detailled links (with specific interfaces and subnetting),
     see command [1mnet add link-ptp [22m.
