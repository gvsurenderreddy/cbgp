[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command shows the AS-level topology previously loaded with the com-
     mand [1mbgp topology load [22m. The default output format (obtained without
     using the [4m--format[24m option) shows a single AS relationship per line. For
     each AS relationship, a code identifies the relationship type. A textual
     description of the AS relationship type can be obtained by mentioning the
     [4m--verbose[24m option.

     An alternate output format can be obtained by using the [4m--format=[24m option.
     A single alternate format is supported : "graphviz". This allows to
     obtain an output file suitable for use with AT&T's graphviz tools, in
     particular [1mdot [22mand [1mneato [22m.

     The [4m--output=[24m option allows to redirect the command's output to a file.
     The file name is provided as the value of the [4m--output=[24m option.
