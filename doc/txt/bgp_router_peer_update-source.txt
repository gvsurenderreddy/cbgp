[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command configures the address used as source to establish a BGP
     session with a neighbor router. The default source address depends on the
     outgoing interface selected when messages are sent towards the neighbor.
     This means that if the routing changes, the BGP session's source address
     might also change and the BGP session might break.

     If the way the BGP session is routed may change or if the BGP session
     must be established between specific interfaces, the [1mupdate-source [22mcom-
     mand must be used to statically define the source address.

     The following example illustrates how the command can be used in a sce-
     nario with a single BGP session between the loopback interfaces of two
     routers connected with two parallel links. In such a scenario, the
     default source address used on the side of router 1.0.0.1 would be
     192.168.0.1 as this is the address of the outgoing address to reach node
     1.0.0.2. Hence, the BGP session will not establish as the neighbor,
     router 1.0.0.2, expects an OPEN message with source address 1.0.0.1 and
     it will receive it with source address 192.168.0.1. To obtain the correct
     behavior, the source addresses used for the BGP session on both sides
     must be explicitly set to the addresses of the respective loopback inter-
     faces using the [1mupdate-source [22mcommand.
