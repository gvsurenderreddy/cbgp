     <[4mon|off[24m> new auto-flush state

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command tells [4mC-BGP[24m to flush the output stream after any commands
     which return information. This is important if the simulator is used by a
     script which waits for a response to a command. The [1mCBGP.pm [22mPerl module
     relies on this option.
