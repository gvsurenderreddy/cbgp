     [1mrt [22m<[4mprefix|address|*[24m>

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     <[4mprefix|address|*[24m> filter for route destination

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command shows the content of the routing table of one node. The com-
     mand takes one parameter to filter the output. The filter parameters can
     be an IP address, an IP prefix or a wildcard (*). If the filter is an IP
     address, the result will contain the routes that match the address (best-
     match). If the filter is an IP prefix, the result will only contain the
     routes towards this prefix (exact-match). Finally, if a wildcard is
     given, all the routes will be shown.

     Output format:


     <prefix> <gateway> <out-iface> <metric> <type>

     where the [4mtype[24m field can take one of the following values:

           STATIC   The route was statically installed with theSy net node
                                   route add command.
           IGP      The route was computed by theSy net domain compute
                                   command.
           BGP      The route was learned by BGP and selected as best.

     Example:


     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.1 show rt *
     1.0.0.2/32      0.0.0.0 1.0.0.2 1       STATIC
     1.0.0.3/32      0.0.0.0 1.0.0.2 1       STATIC
     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.2 show rt *
     1.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0 1.0.0.1 1       STATIC
     1.0.0.3/32      192.168.0.2     ---     1       STATIC
     192.168.0.0/24  0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1     1       STATIC
