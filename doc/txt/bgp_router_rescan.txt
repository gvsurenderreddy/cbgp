[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command is used to rescan the BGP routes contained in one BGP
     router. This command must be used after changes in static and IGP routes
     that could cause changes in the outcome of the decision process.

     The command works as follows. First it builds the list of all BGP pre-
     fixes known by the router. Then, for each prefix, it checks if the selec-
     tion of the best route towards this prefix depends on the state of static
     or IGP routes. If so, the decision process for this prefix is re-run.
