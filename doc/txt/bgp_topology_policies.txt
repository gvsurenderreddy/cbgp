[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command configures the route filters of the BGP sessions according
     to business policies specified in the loaded AS-level topology (see [1mbgp[0m
     [1mtopology load [22m).

     The filters are composed of two parts. The first part enforces the
     [4mvalley-free[24m property. The second part enforces a preference for routes
     depending on the type of neighbor they are received from. Routes from
     customers receive the highest preference, followed by routes received
     from shared-cost peers and finally, routes received from providers are
     the less preferred. The filters are implemented using the LOCAL-PREF and
     COMMUNITIES.
