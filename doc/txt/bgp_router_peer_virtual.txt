[1mNAME[0m
     [1mbgp router peer virtual [22m-- configure a BGP session as virtual

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mvirtual[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command configures one BGP neighbor as "virtual". A virtual peer is
     used to feed [4mC-BGP[24m with real BGP messages (see [1mbgp router peer recv [22m). A
     virtual peer does not maintain a BGP session with another BGP router in
     the simulation. Moreover, the router will not send BGP messages to a vir-
     tual peer.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     This command is best used in combination with command [1mrecv [22mto inject real
     BGP routes in the simulation.
