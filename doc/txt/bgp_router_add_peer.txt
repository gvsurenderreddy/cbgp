     [1mbgp router add peer [22m-- add a new neighbor to a BGP router

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mpeer [22m<[4mas-num[24m> <[4maddr[24m>

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     <[4mas-num[24m> ASN of the new neighbor

     <[4maddr[24m> IP address of the new neighbor

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command adds a new neighbor to one BGP router. The new neighbor has
     the address [4maddr[24m and belongs to the domain with ASN [4mas-num[24m . This command
     also configures for this neighbor default input and output filters that
     will accept any route. See the [1mbgp router peer filter [22mfor more informa-
     tion about the route filters.

     The following example illustrates how to declare an internal (iBGP) ses-
     sion between two routers. The [1mbgp add router [22mis used to declare both
     routers in AS1. The [1madd peer [22mcommand is used to declare the BGP neigh-
     bors. On router 1.0.0.1, the command declares neighbor 1.0.0.2 in AS1.
     There is no explicit mention that it is an iBGP session. This is derived
     from the fact that the local router and the neighbor are in the same AS.
