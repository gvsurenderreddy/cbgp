     [1mbgp router peer next-hop-self [22m-- send the router ID as next-hop to this
     peer

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mnext-hop-self[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command configures a router to replace the next-hop of routes
     received from the specified peer by its own router ID when these routes
     are redistributed. This is useful to distribute routes from an external
     peer that has an eBGP session over a static route. The next-hop announced
     by this peer is probably unreachable from the other routers in the
     domain.

     In the following example, router 1.0.0.1 has two peers: 2.0.0.1 is an
     external peer (in AS2) while 1.0.0.2 is an internal peer. The command
     [1mnext-hop-self [22minstructs router 1.0.0.1 to send routes received from
     2.0.0.1 to 1.0.0.2 with a modified next-hop: its own router-ID (1.0.0.1
     in this case). Without [1mnext-hop-self [22m, the next-hop would not have been
     modified (it could for example be 2.0.0.1).


     bgp router 1.0.0.1
       add peer 2 2.0.0.1
       peer 2.0.0.1 next-hop-self
       add peer 1 1.0.0.2



[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     In place of the router ID, another next-hop value can be configured by
     using command [1mnext-hop [22m.
