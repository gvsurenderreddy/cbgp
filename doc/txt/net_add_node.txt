      disable loopback interface creation

     <[4maddr[24m> address (identifier) of the new node

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command adds a new node to the topology. The node is identified by
     an IP address ( [4maddr[24m ). This address must be unique and it must be dif-
     ferent from 0.0.0.0.

     By default, when a node is created, a loopback interface numbered with
     the node's identifier is created. This behaviour can be changed by pro-
     viding the [4m--no-loopback[24m option.

     When created, a new node only supports IP routing as well as a simplified
     ICMP protocol. If you want to add support for the BGP protocol, consider
     using command [1mbgp add router [22m.

     Here is how to create a simple 2 nodes topology:

     net add node 1.0.0.1
     net add node 1.0.0.2
     net add link 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2

     To create links, consider using commands [1mnet add link [22mand [1mnet add link-[0m
     [1mptp [22m.
