     <[4mtransit|stub[24m> conditions traversal by IGP computed paths

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command adds a new subnet to the simulation. A subnet is a simpli-
     fied model of a LAN where multiple nodes can connect. The subnet is iden-
     tified by an IP [4mprefix[24m .

     A subnet can have two different behaviours: "transit" or "stub", as spec-
     ified with the [4mtransit|stub[24m argument. If the subnet is in transit mode,
     that means that the IGP model can compute shortest-paths that traverse
     this subnet. Otherwise, if the subnet is in stub mode, no shortest-path
     can traverse the subnet (it will only be a leaf in shortest-paths trees).

     paths.
