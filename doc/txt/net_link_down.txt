[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mdown[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command changes the state of one link to [1mDOWN [22m. Note that after the
     state of a link is changed, it is required to update the intra- and
     interdomain paths, using the [1mnet domain compute [22mcommand. If the nodes run
     BGP, it is also important to run the [1mbgp domain rescan [22mcommand.
