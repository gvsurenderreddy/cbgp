[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command starts the establishment of one BGP session. Actually, the
     session is not necessarily established. The command rather sets the ses-
     sion as administratively active. This means that BGP OPEN messages will
     be temptatively sent to the corresponding neighbor. If the neighbor
     answers, the session will go to the ESTABLISHED state. If the neighbor
     does not answer, the session will remain in OPENWAIT state. Otherwise, if
     the OPEN message could not be sent, due to for instance a routing prob-
     lem, the session will go to the ACTIVE state.

     Note that if BGP messages need to be exchanged, they will be put into the
     simulator's queue. You will need to issue a [1msim run [22mto process them.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     To stop a session, use command [1mbgp router X peer down [22m.
