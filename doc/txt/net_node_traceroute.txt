[1mNAME[0m
     [1mnet node traceroute [22m-- traces the route to another node

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mtraceroute [22m<[4maddr[24m>

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     <[4maddr[24m> destination node

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command traces the route from one node to another, much like the
     classical [4mtraceroute[24m networking utility. It sends ICMP echo-request mes-
     sages from the source note to the destination node with an increasing TTL
     value.

     The following example illustrates how to use the [1mtraceroute [22mcommand:

     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.0 traceroute 1.0.0.4
       1     1.0.0.1 (1.0.0.1)       icmp error (time-exceeded)
       2     1.0.0.3 (1.0.0.3)       icmp error (time-exceeded)
       3     1.0.0.4 (1.0.0.4)       reply
     cbgp>



     Although the [1mtraceroute [22mcommand sends its probes with the same mechanisms
     (same protocol stack) as other messages in the simulation (especially
     BGP), the messages sent by [1mtraceroute [22mare put in a separate simulation
     queue which is processed immediately. This is the reason why there is no
     need to run [1msim run [22mto process [1mtraceroute[0m

     reachability of nodes.
