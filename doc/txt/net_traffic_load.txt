[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command loads a traffic matrix out of a text file. The text file
     does not contain a "real" matrix, but instead a series of flows. A flow
     mentions a source and a destination as well as a volume. There are dif-
     ferent ways to identify the source and the destination of a flow.

     To clarify the notion of flows, let's use the following example traffic
     matrix file. The file has 5 lines, 4 of which describe traffic flows. The
     first line is a header line that informs C-BGP of the columns provided in
     the file. In the example, a flow has an IP address as source ( [4msrcIP[24m )
     and an IP address as destination ( [4mdstIP[24m ). Flows shown in the example
     also mention a destination mask (prefix length - [4mdstMask[24m ) and a volume (
     [4moctets[24m ).


     srcIP dstIP dstMask octets
     1.0.0.1 3.0.0.1 32 1
     1.0.0.1 3.0.0.3 32 2
     1.0.0.3 2.0.0.1 32 4
     2.0.0.3 1.0.0.3 32 8



     When the above traffic matrix is loaded, the following actions are per-
     formed by C-BGP. For each flow, C-BGP identifies a source node based on
     the flow's source. From that node, a lookup is performed in the routing
     table to find an entry towards the flow's destination. The link between
     the node and the routing table entry's next-hop is loaded with the flow's
     volume. Then, the process continues from the next-hop node until the des-
     tination is reached or a node on the path has no entry in its routing ta-
     ble.

     Actually, for each flow, the operations performed by C-BGP are equivalent
     to a call of the [1mrecord-route [22mcommand with the [4m--load[24m option. The follow-
     ing example illustrate how the use of [1mrecord-route [22mcould be used to load
     the first flow in the above traffic matrix file.

     The columns/fields that can be specified in the traffic matrix header
     line are shown in the following table along with a short description. The
     field names are inspired from those used in the flow-tools utility (see-
     http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/).

           srcAS         source AS number
           dstAS         destination AS number

           dstIP         destination IP address
           srcMask       source IP prefix length (ignored)
           dstMask       destination IP prefix length
           octets        volume

     The default flow source identifier is provided by the [4msrcIP[24m field. This
     behaviour can be modified by using the [4m--src[24m option. This option can take
     the following values: [1mip [22mif the source is an IP address (default) or [1masn[0m
     if the source is an AS number (ASN).

     The default flow destination identifier is provided by the [4mdstIP[24m field.
     This behaviour can be modified by using the [4m--dst[24m option. This option can
     take the following values: [1mip [22mif the destination is an IP address
     (default) or [1mpfx [22mif the destination is an IP prefix. In the later case,
     an exact-match search is performed in each node's routing table to find
     the next-hop.
