     [1mbgp domain rescan [22m-- re-scan the BGP routes for changes

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mrescan[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command re-scans the BGP routes held by all the routers in the spec-
     ified domain. It looks for changes in the routing state that would need
     that the BGP decision process be re-run. Examples of such changes are:
     change in the availability of IGP routes or change in the IGP metrics. If
     any change is detected, the decision process is re-run for the concerned
     prefixes. New events are therefore queued and the [1msim run [22mcommand should
     be called..Pp

     Note that calling this command is equivalent to calling the [1mbgp router[0m
     [1mrescan [22mcommand individually for each router in the domain.
