     <[4mweight[24m> new IGP weight

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command sets the IGP [4mweight[24m of the link. If the link is a point-to-
     point link added with command [1mnet add link [22mthe option [4m--bidir[24m can be
     specified to change the IGP weight of the link in both directions.

     Here is an example that shows how the IGP weight of a link can be set to
     100 in both directions:

     net add node 1.0.0.1
     net add node 1.0.0.2
     net add link 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2
     net link 1.0.0.1 1.0.0.2 igp-weight --bidir 100



     If the link supports multiple IGP weights (i.e. was created with the
     [4m--depth[24m option), then the [4m--tos[24m option can be used to specify which IGP
     weight to set.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     See command [1mnet domain compute [22mto learn how to compute shortest-paths
     routes with the IGP model.

     This command actually makes use of a simpler command to change the IGP
     weight for an interface. This command is [1mnet node X iface igp-weight [22m.
