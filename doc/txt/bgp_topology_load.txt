     [[1m---format= [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      format of the AS-level topology file

     <[4mfile[24m> name of the AS-level topology file

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command loads an AS-level topology from the specified [1mfile [22m. Differ-
     ent input file formats can be used.

     The [1m--format [22moption specifies the expected format of the input file. The
     default is "rexford". The other possible formats are "caida" and
     "meulle". Each of these file formats was used by different authors of AS-
     level topology inferrence algorithms.

           [4mrexford[24m is based on work by L. Subramanian et al ("Characterizing
           the Internet Hierarchy from Multiple Vantage Points", INFOCOM
           2002). I you are wondering where the name "rexford" comes from, it
           is the name of one of the paper's authors.

           [4mcaida[24m was used by the Cooperative Association for Internet Data
           Analysis (CAIDA) to publish its AS relationships files. See-
           http://www.caida.org/data/active/as-relationshipsfor more details.

           [4mmeulle[24m was proposed by Mickael Meulle (from France Telecom RD, now
           Orange Labs). Seehttp://perso.rd.francetelecom.fr/meullefor more
           details.


     Once an AS-level topology has been loaded, [4mC-BGP[24m can optionnally build a
     network where each domain (AS) is composed of a single router (see the
     command [1mbgp topology install [22m). The identifier (IP address) of each
     router is derived from its domain's number (ASN) according to an address-
     ing scheme. There are currently two possible addressing schemes that can
     be selected using the [1m--addr-sch [22moption. The default addressing scheme
     will derive a router's IP address by multiplying the ASN by 65536. For
     instance, if the router is in AS7018, then its IP address will be
     27.106.0.0. This can be changed if the [4m--addr-sch[24m option is used with the
     value "local". In this case the IP address of our example would become
     0.0.27.106.

     In the "rexford" file format, each line of the file specifies a relation-
     ship between two Internet domains, as follows:

     <domain-1> <domain-2> <relationship> [<delay>]

     The [1mrelationship [22mfield can be one of the following:

           [1mValue    Meaning[0m
           0        peer-to-peer relationship
           1        provider-to-customer relationship


[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     The following commands are also important to setup a simulation based on
     an AS-level topology: [1mbgp topology install [22m, [1mbgp topology policies [22mand
     [1mbgp topology run [22m.
