[1mNAME[0m
     [1mbgp router peer filter add-rule match [22m-- defines the predicate of a rule
     in a filter

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mmatch [22m<[4mpredicate[24m>

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     <[4mpredicate[24m> the predicate associated with the rule

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command defines the predicate of the current rule. The predicate is
     provided as the command argument. The predicate is a logical combination
     of atomic predicates. Each atomic predicate can be used to test a single
     attribute of a route.

     The following atomic predicates are supported:

           [1mPredicate expression    Description[0m
           any                     all routes
           community is [4mC[24m          routes that contain community [4mC[0m
           next-hop is [4mN[24m           routes whose next-hop is [4mN[0m
           next-hop in [4mP[24m           routes whose next-hop is in [4mP[0m
           prefix is [4mP[24m             routes whose prefix is [4mP[0m
           prefix in [4mP[24m             routes whose prefix is in [4mP[0m
           path [4mR[24m                  routes whose AS-path matches regexp [4mR[0m


     The following example defines a filter rule that discards routes origi-
     nated by AS11537 (11537 is the latest ASN in the AS-path):

     add-rule
       match 'path "11537$"'
       action deny



     When providing the predicate expression, care must be taken to correctly
     enclose it with quotes. The [4mC-BGP[24m parser relies on a simple tokenization
     mechanism that splits a line into tokens separated by spaces. There is an
     exception for spaces that appear in quoted text. If you want to provide
     an expression that contains multiple words, you need to quote it (using "
     or '). Actually, all the predicate expressions except "any" (which is a
     single word) need to be quoted.

     Sometimes, quoting is also required by the atomic predicate. An example
     is "path [4mR[24m " where [4mR[24m is a regular expression that needs to be quoted if
     it includes spaces. In this case, two levels of quoting are required. One
     option is to write "path

     Atomic predicates can be combined using logic operators to form more com-
     plex predicates. The supported operators are as follows:

           [1mSymbol    Operator[0m
           |         or
           &         and
           !         not


     The following example defines a filter rule that prepends twice the AS-
     path of routes with community 1 or community 2:

     add-rule
       match "community is 1 | community is 2"
       action "as-path prepend 2"
