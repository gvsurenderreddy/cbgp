     [1mbgp router show peers [22m-- show the peers of one BGP router

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mpeers[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command shows the list of peers of one router as well as their sta-
     tus. For each peer, the command shows its ASN as well as the state of the
     BGP session with this peer. In addition, the command also shows the
     options specific to each peer.

     The session with the peer can be in one of the following states:

           [1mSession State    Description[0m
           IDLE             administratively down.
           ACTIVE           administratively up, but not established.
           ESTABLISHED      established and BGP routes can be exchanged.
           OPENWAIT         OPEN message sent, but no answer received yet.


     When the session is in [1mIDLE [22mstate, that means that the session is admin-
     istratively down. The administrative state of the session can be changed
     using the [1mbgp router peer up [22mcommand. The session can also be in the
     [1mACTIVE [22mstate. This state indicates that the session is administratively
     up but due to the current routing state, it is not established. This can
     occur if there is no route towards the peer. The session can also be in
     [1mESTABLISHED [22mstate. This state indicates that the session could be estab-
     lished and that BGP routes can be exchanged with the peer. Finally, the
     [1mOPENWAIT [22mstate indicates that the session has been partially opened. An
     OPEN message has been sent to the peer but no answer has been received
     yet. This can be due to the OPEN message still being in the simulator's
     queue (if [1msim run [22mhas not been called). This can also occur in case of
     reachability problems between the local router and the peer.

     Output format:

     <peer> <as-num> <status> <router-id> [<options>]



     The following example shows the state of two BGP sessions. The sessions
     are initially in the OPENWAIT state because the BGP OPEN messages have
     been sent but are still in the simulator's queue. Then, command [1msim run[0m
     is used to process these messages. Finally, the status of the BGP session
     is shown again. Both sessions are now in the ESTABLISHED state.
