[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     <[4mcisco|mrt|custom[24m> the mode used to dump BGP routes

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command selects which output format is used to dump BGP routes.
     There are currently three possible modes: [1mmrt [22m, [1mcisco [22mand [1mcustom [22m.

     With the [1mmrt [22mmode, routes are dumped as with the [1mroute_btoa [22mtool from the
     Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRTd), using the [1m-m [22moption. In this for-
     mat, the route's fields are written on a single line, using a '|' separa-
     tor. Example:

     _|129.250.0.85|2914|3.0.0.0/8|2914 1239 80|IGP|129.250.0.85|100|10|2914:420 2914:2000 2914:3000 65504:1239||||


     With the [1mcisco [22mmode, routes are shown using CISCO IOS's format for the
     [1mshow ip bgp [22mcommand. Example:

     *> 3.0.0.0/8    129.250.0.85    100     10      2914 1239 80    i


     Finally, if the specified mode is not [1mcisco [22mor [1mmrt [22m, the command argument
     is interpreted as an output format specifier. The output format specifier
     takes the form of a string which specifies the output format and the
     fields that will appear in the output. The modus operandi is similar to
     that of the [4mprintf[24m function in C.

     The acceptable format specifiers are as follows:

           [1mSpecifier    Field[0m
           i            IP address of the BGP peer
           a            ASN of the BGP peer
           p            destination prefix
           l            LOCAL-PREF attribute
           P            AS-Path attribute
           m            MED attribute
           o            ORIGIN attribute
           n            next-hop
           c            COMMUNITIES attribute
           e            EXT-COMMUNITIES attribute
           O            ORIGINATOR-ID attribute
           C            CLUSTER-ID-LIST attribute


     The following example shows how to use a custom output format specifier
     that would only show the AS-Path of routes in future route dumps.
