[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command defines a new route-map. A route-map is a BGP route filter
     that can be shared in multiple BGP session filters. It can help reduce
     the memory footprint of simulations in case the same filter is used in
     multiple BGP sessions. It might also help write more readable simulation
     scripts.
