[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command computes the routes between all the nodes that belong to one
     domain. How the computation is performed depends on the domain's type.
     Basically, [4mC-BGP[24m only supports one domain type for the moment and it is
     named [1migp [22m. In this model, the intradomain routes are the shortest-paths
     according to the domain's link weights (see also [1mnet link igp-weight [22m).

     Example:


     # Create IGP domain 1 and assign nodes 0.1.0.1, 0.1.0.2
     # and 0.1.0.3 to this domain
     net add domain 1 igp
     net node 0.1.0.1 domain 1
     net node 0.1.0.2 domain 1
     net node 0.1.0.3 domain 1

     # Compute the shortest-paths between all the domain's nodes
     net domain 1 compute



     The computed SPTs can optionally be kept in memory if the option
     [4m--keep-spt[24m is used. These SPTs can later be displayed or savec in a file
     using command [1mnet node X show spt [22m.
