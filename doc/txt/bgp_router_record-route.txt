[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     [[1m---exact-match [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optionally performs exact-match

     [[1m---preserve-dups [4m[22mvalue[24m]
      optionally keep duplicate ASNs in paths

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command records the AS-level route from one router towards the given
     [4mprefix[24m . The command works as follows. Starting from the source router,
     it performs a best-match lookup in the router's BGP RIB. If a route is
     found, it jumps to the next-hop router and, again, performs a lookup for
     the same prefix. The algorithm stops when the next-hop router is the
     router itself (locally originated route). For each traversed router, the
     ASN of the router is appended to the resulting trace. By default, dupli-
     cate ASNs are not added, but it is possible to keep them using the
     [4m--preserve-dups[24m option.

     It is possible to make use of an exact-match lookup instead of the
     default best-match lookup by mentionning the [4m--exact-match[24m option.

     Output format:


     <source> <destination> <status> <AS-Path>



     Example:


     cbgp> bgp router 0.0.0.1 record-route 0.1.0.1/32
     0.0.0.1 0.1.0.1/32      SUCCESS 0 2 1
