     [1mnet ntf load [22m-- load the topology of a domain in NTF format

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mload [22m<[4mfilename[24m>

[1mARGUMENTS[0m
     <[4mfilename[24m> name of the NTF file

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command loads the given NTF file into the simulator. An NTF file
     contains a description of a topology. Each line of the file specifies an
     adjacency between two nodes. The nodes are identified by their IP
     addresses. In addition, the file also specifies the IGP metric associated
     with the adjacency. It can also optionally define the propagation delay
     along this adjacency.

     When [4mC-BGP[24m loads the NTF file, it creates all the unexisting nodes and
     links. It will not worry if some nodes or links already exist before the
     [1mnet ntf load [22mcommand was called.

     Input format:


     <node-1> <node-2> <weight> [<delay>]
