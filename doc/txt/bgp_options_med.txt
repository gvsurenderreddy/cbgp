     <[4mmed-type[24m> new MED behaviour

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command changes the behaviour of the MED-based rule of the BGP deci-
     sion process. Two modes are currently supported: [1mdeterministic [22mand
     [1malways-compare [22m.


     If the [1mdeterministic [22mmode is selected, then the MED-based rule will only
     compare the MED value of routes received from the same AS.

     If the [1malways-compare [22mmode is selected, then the MED-based rule will com-
     pare the MEd value of routes even if they are received from different
     neighbor ASes.
