[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This command adds a point-to-point link between two nodes. The nodes are
     identified using parameters [4maddr-src[24m and [4maddr-dst[24m .

     New interfaces are created on the source and destination nodes and are
     connected together. The addresses of these interfaces are specified using
     the parameters [4miface-id[24m . These parameters must include the interface IP
     address + a subnet length. The subnet length and prefix of both inter-
     faces must be equal !

     The following example shows how to create a simple 2 nodes topology using
     this command:

     net add node 1.0.0.1
     net add node 1.0.0.2
     net add link-ptp 1.0.0.1 192.168.0.1/30 1.0.0.2 192.168.0.2/30

     With the above example, nodes 1.0.0.1 and 1.0.0.2 will both have 2 inter-
     faces: one loopback interface and one ptp interface. This can be verified
     using command [1mnet node X show ifaces [22mas show in the following example:

     cbgp> net node 1.0.0.1 show ifaces
     lo      1.0.0.1/32
     ptp     192.168.0.1/30
